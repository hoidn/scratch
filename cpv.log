> /ask The pump-probe curve for the current run looks weird. What might be wrong?

Based on the p-value uniformity check results, the designated background ROI [80, 95, 5, 45] appears to contain signal when it should not. This is evidenced by:

 1 Mean p-value of 0.394 (should be 0.5)
 2 Highly significant KS test (p=6.496e-17)
 3 Large z-score deviation (9.0)

This contaminated background ROI would affect the null distribution calculation, which in turn would distort the pump-probe curve. The solution would be to select a different background ROI location
that shows proper uniformity in its p-values.
